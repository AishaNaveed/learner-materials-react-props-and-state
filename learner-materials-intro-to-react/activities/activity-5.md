# Activity 5

Our `App.js` file is looking more and more like a React project should look!

Both our navbar and header have been stripped out into reusable components and so has our Cindy Clawford cat card. 

Great work - you're getting the hang of this! ðŸ™Œ

If you came into any trouble or would like to double check your code, you can see an example solution [here](https://github.com/techreturners/learner-materials-intro-to-react/tree/activity-4-example-solution)

Using what you've learnt about creating components and importing them into `App.js`, create components for:

- Little Miss Purrfect cat card
- El Taco cat card
- My Gwumpy cat card
- Footer

Remember to type out your functions and import statements so you can memorize the syntax. Format your document to keep things neat. ðŸ’…

When you've done converting the above elements into components you can move on to the extension [Activity 6](./activity-6.md)
