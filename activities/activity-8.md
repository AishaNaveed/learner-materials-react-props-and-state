# Extension - Chuck Norris Level üëä

You now have the opportunity to put what you've learnt into practice.

Our journey together ends, and from here you're going it alone, Ninjas!

Much to our Cats disgust, you may have spotted some Dog data lurking around when exploring our Data file. 

Knowing what you've learnt from looping through cats, can you create a Dog Component and render some dog cards on the screen?

- Remember to add a key

- Map over the dog data above or below where you map over the cat data

- Try and do it from memory to test yourself!


# Extension 2 - favFoods things about to get TASTY

You may have noticed that in our Cat cards, our cats favorite foods are squished together without spaces between each food item. 

This is because some of the food items are in an array and when they are rendered on the page our program doesn't know there needs to be white space between items.
