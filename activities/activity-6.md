# Activity 6 - Passing Dynamic Data

Currently our Header says there are 0 cats in our App. This isn't accurate!

Now we know how to pass props to our components, let's update our Header component to reflect the true number of cats in our ~~basket~~ application.

This is a perfect example of "state" or "dynamic data" in our application. The number of cats we have might change and our cat count should update to reflect that.

One way to do this is by passing cat data (props) down to our Header component.

Can you remember how to do this without looking?

Have a go... if you get stuck:

<details>
<summary>Click here to see the answer!</summary>
<pre>

// App.js 

`<Header props={cats}/>`

// Header.js

`function Header(props) {..}`

</pre>
</details>


Now our Header is receiving our cat data, we could add some JavaScript to count how many cats there are. 

- How would we check or count the number of objects in an array in JavaScript?

- How could we insert this JavaScript logic into our Header element?

<pre>

// Header.js

```function Header(props) {

  return (
    <header className="header__container">
      <h1 className="header__title header__welcome">Welcome to React!</h1>
      <h2 className="header__title">There are currently {props.props.length} Cats in this Cat App</h2>
    </header>
  )
}

export default Header
```

Let's break it down. ðŸ”¨

- We are passing our cat properties into our Header component

- We are using curly braces to replace the 0 with some JavaScript logic

- In the curly braces we use JavaScript Dot Notation to get to our nested cat properties

- We use the JavaScript `.length` property to count how many cat objects there are 

- Boom! Our Cat App now accurately reflects how many cats there are - 16! ðŸ˜º

</pre>
</details>


To test whether our Header component is accurately reflecting our applications state though, let's add another cat to our basket to make sure. 

In our `useState()` function add Captain Catface:

```
{
      "name": "Captain Catface",
      "species": "Sea Cattain",
      "favFoods": ["fish, rum"],
      "birthYear": 2016,
      "photo": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2016.05/article/5743512dc46188d2298b45a1.jpg",
      "alt": "A cat wearing a ships captains uniform"
    }
```

Our header should now say "There are currently 17 Cats in this Cat App". Great work! 

Let's push this to the next level! [Activity 7](./activity-7.md)
