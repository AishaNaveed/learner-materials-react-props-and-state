# Activity 6 - passing Dynamic Data

Now we know how to pass props to our components, let's update our Header component to reflect how many cats we have in our ~~basket~~ app.

One way to do this is my passing our cat data down to Header.

Can you remember how to do this without looking?

<pre>

// App.js 

`<Header props={cats}/>`

// Header.js

`function Header(props) {..}`

</pre>
</details>


Now our Header is receiving our cat data, we could add some JavaScript to count how many cats there are. 

- How could we count the number of objects in an array in JavaScript?

- Then how could we insert this JavaScript into our Header element?

<pre>

// Header.js

```function Header(props) {

  return (
    <header className="header__container">
      <h1 className="header__title header__welcome">Welcome to React!</h1>
      <h2 className="header__title">There are currently {props.props.length} Cats in this Cat App</h2>
    </header>
  )
}

export default Header
```

Let's break it down. ðŸ”¨

- We are passing our cat properties into our Header component

- We are using curly braces to replace the 0 with some JavaScript logic

- We use object dot notation to get to our nested object properties

- We use the JavaScript `.length` property to count how many cat objects there are

- Boom! Our Cat App will accurately reflect how many cats there are! ðŸ˜º

Now let's really push this to the next level! [Activity 7](./activity-7.md)
