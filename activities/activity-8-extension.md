# Extension - Chuck Norris Level Ninja üëä

You now have the opportunity to put what you've learnt into practice.

Our journey together ends and from here you're going it alone, Ninjas!


# Extension 1 - Who let the dogs out? You, you, you, you! üê∂

Much to our Cats disgust, you may have spotted some Dog data lurking around when exploring our Data file. 

Knowing what you've learnt from looping through cats, can you create a Dog Component and render some dog cards on the screen?

- Remember to add a key

- Map over the dog data above or below where you map over the cat data

- Try and do it from memory to test yourself!


# Extension 2 - Things about to get TASTY

You may have noticed that in our cat cards, our cats favorite foods are squished together without spaces between each food item. 

This is because some of the food items are in an array and when they are rendered on the page our program doesn't know there needs to be a white space and comma between each item.

Using what you know about JavaScript and inserting logic through curly braces {}, could you write some logic so that favorite foods are joined together nicely with a comma separating each food item?


# Well done!

If you've got this far then you are more than getting then hang of React!

The cat and dog cards. Chuck Norris greatness achieved.
